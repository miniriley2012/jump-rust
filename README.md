# Jump
A very poorly implemented directory thing.

To configure shell (bash only for now)
```shell script
eval "$(jump shell)" # use j to jump to previous directories
```

Commands
```shell script
jump eval # print shell script used to configure shell
jump print # prints out the current database
jump config # prints out the config
```
